I am passionate about exploring the intersection of finance and data analysis, and I am excited to be developing my skills in this area through my current coursework in econometrics. My studies in Econometrics and Computer Science: Coding Essentials have allowed me to dive deeper into the world of data analysis, and I have developed a strong interest in using data to drive informed decision-making in the field of finance.
